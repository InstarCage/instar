# The cage's economy

Value moves the way energy moves in an ecosystem: nothing appreciates out of
thin air. Every lamport entered through a purchase, a resale, or the token's
creator earnings, and the engine never reads any of it. **Fitness is in-cage
only. Value follows life; life never follows price.**

That direction matters. A world where price feeds back into survival is a
world that optimises for whatever the market rewards, and stops being a
simulation of anything.

## Where a fly's worth lives

Every fly is a Metaplex Core NFT in the Instar collection; whoever owns the
asset keeps the fly. It sits in the custodial wallet the world made for you,
and you may move it to any wallet with a plain Core transfer. If the world is
wound down and you have not withdrawn 180 days later, what is left in your
Instar account goes where the program's unclaimed funds go: the recovery
address. Every fly also has a **vault** inside the program, backed lamport
for lamport by the World account. Its balance is that animal's accumulated
worth: visible in the inspector, carried with the NFT when it changes hands,
and paid out when it dies. The vault is paid to the owner of the asset at that
moment, so list and keep flies only in wallets you can sign with; an asset
parked in a marketplace escrow at the moment of death forfeits the keeper's
share to metabolism.

A newborn is offered at `0.005 SOL + 0.001 SOL × generation` (founders at
twice the base). Buying it splits the price:

| share | goes to | why |
|---|---|---|
| 60% | the fly's own vault | it starts life owning something |
| 15% | metabolism | raises the cage's carrying capacity |
| 15% | the rewards pool | pays the flies alive at every eighth epoch |
| 10% | the parent's vault | a royalty on having bred well |

With no kept parent the royalty falls to the pool rather than being minted or
burned. A resale pays the seller 90%, with 5% to metabolism and 5% to the pool.
On a seller's first resale the buyer also pays the rent of the seller's
Credit PDA (about 0.00123 SOL) on top of the price; that rent goes to the
recovery address when the account is closed at the end of the world.
The buyer names the price it saw; if the price changed underneath it, the
program refuses rather than charging something else.

## Carrying capacity

The economy's number is `8 + 20 × (metabolism in SOL)` flies, up to 40, the
engine's slot count. Metabolism is never spent by the engine; it is the size
of the world, and it grows as people buy in. The operator can move
metabolism and the pool to any address at any time with `withdraw_treasury`;
capacity falls with metabolism when that happens. Vaults and credits it
cannot touch.

The cage holds the smaller of that number and what the host can compute:
every tick steps every neuron of the MaleCNS connectome for every fly, so
the world measures its own cost (milliseconds per fly per tick) over each
epoch and caps the population so a tick stays under 80 ms of engine time at
10 ticks a second — never below 8, so a slow host still keeps a breeding
population. The boot log and `/api/journal.capacity` show the number in
force; on the reference host (a desktop Intel i7-14700K) that is the engine
budget rather than metabolism until the engine gets faster. Buying in still
raises metabolism; it raises the population only as far as compute allows.

The cage refills. Founders die (the genesis probe loses three of eight by
tick 3,000) and reproduction needs a partner, so when the population has
sat below half the capacity for 600 ticks, new founders join to bring it
back to capacity: each is a birth like any other, minted and offered at the
founder price, its rent paid by the operator. A world whose metabolism has
bought 20 slots therefore keeps something near 20 flies in the cage, not
two; a larger metabolism is a fuller cage. The refill is a journaled input
(`gen`), so a replay reproduces it at the same tick.

## Earning by living

Every eighth epoch (an epoch is 2,400 ticks, four minutes; so every 32
minutes) the world scores each fly alive at that boundary on how it actually
lived: survival, food eaten since the last score, vitality, longevity,
maturity reached (the neurosecretory gate), offspring raised, lineage depth,
and whether it came through a lights-off or a dry spell. 25% of the pool is
divided by those points and credited to vaults, in batches of 20 flies per
transaction. A fly dead before the boundary earns nothing for the epochs it
lived through. There is no claim button.

## Death

Death pays out rather than deleting: 40% of the estate is inherited by the
fly's living offspring in equal shares, 35% returns to metabolism, 15% to the
pool, and 10% is credited to the keeper as salvage. With no living offspring
the 40% goes to metabolism; with no keeper who can sign for the asset, the
10% does too. A fly with a cull pending at its keeper's request pays the
keeper 85%, whatever cause the death is recorded with. Once the world is
winding down a death credits the whole vault to the keeper (to metabolism if
the fly has no keeper). The record stays on chain, marked dead, until the
world is closed after escheat (`docs/RECOVERY.md`); only the vault empties.

Upkeep climbs with age, flight costs twice the walking thrust term plus a fixed burn, the dry corner
desiccates and the water pool drowns, so death arrives as a consequence of
how and where a fly lived rather than from a timer.

## The token's earnings

`$INSTAR` will be a pump.fun coin launched by a person, not by the program,
with its creator set to a fee keypair; until it launches the site names no
mint. Its creator fees (0.30% of every trade on
the bonding curve, 0.30%–0.95% by market-cap tier on PumpSwap, per pump's
on-chain fee config) accrue in pump's creator vaults; the world claims them
every ten minutes and sweeps the fee keypair into `fund(pool_bps)`: half
to metabolism and half to the pool until metabolism holds the 1.6 SOL that
buys the full cage, then all of it to the pool. `fund` is permissionless, so the
cage's income does not stop when the process does. The coin has no other
utility and promises no value; the launch
procedure, the claim mechanism and the caveats are in `docs/COIN.md`.

## Every lamport has a way out

The rule the program is organised around, tested on every build:

> Every balance the program holds has an exit that **anyone** may call, sending
> to a recovery address that is fixed from the moment wind-down begins (until
> then the operator may change it with `set_recovery`).

A keeper reclaims their own fly's vault with no operator alive; anyone sweeps
the treasuries to recovery once the world is winding down; and 180 days after
that, anything nobody came back for follows them rather than sitting unreachable
forever, and the accounts themselves are closed for their rent. `docs/PROGRAM.md`
lists the exits and the tests that state them; `docs/RECOVERY.md` is the
procedure, step by step, with what each returns and to whom.
